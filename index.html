<p class=heading1>Small online hobby engineering tools</p>
<br>
This page contains some small hobby/mode engineering tools I've written for my own personal use. <br>
<br>
<a href="/cgi-bin/division-calculator.pl">Division Calculator</a> - Online calculator for index plate combinations for a given set of plates.<br>
<br>
<a href="/cgi-bin/index-plate-generator.pl">Index Plate Generator</a> - Online / browser based tool for drawing indexing plates (for printing out and using on e.g. rotary tables).<br>
<br>
<a href="/cgi-bin/change-gear-calculator.pl">Change Gear Calculator</a> - Online / browser based tool for calculating simple (i.e. no compound gears) and compound lathe gear setups. Also draws a full chart of the simple gears. Works for both metric and imperial threads and machines.<br>          
<br>
<a href="/cgi-bin/dial-generator.pl">Dial Generator</a> - Online / browser based tool for generating dials - useful if your lead screw doesn't have a dial, and you want to hack a quick one together.<br>          
<br>
<br>
Note, the tools are provided as is. I take no responsibility for any accuracy or inaccuracy - I'm not a "real" machinist, simply a hobbyist.<br>
