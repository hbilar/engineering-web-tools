<p class=heading1>Dial generator</p>

<p class=info1>This is an online program to generate an image of a dial. The dial can be printed and stuck on whatever sturdy material, and attached to e.g. the lead screws of a lathe etc. Basic, I know, but better than the complete lack of dials which is common on &quot;classic&quot; hobby lathes.</p>
