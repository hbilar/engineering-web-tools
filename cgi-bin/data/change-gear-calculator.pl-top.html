<p class=heading1>Change gear calculator</p>

<p class=info1>This is an online calculator to calculate what change gears to use to generate a specific thread for an imperial leadscrew lathe.</p>

<p class=info1>The available gears are given as a comma separated list of integer values (For example, if your gears have 11, 12 and 15 teeth, enter &quot;11, 12, 15&quot; in the textbox below).</p>

<p class=info1>The program will generate both simple and compound gear trains. Some lathes don't support one or the other, so your mileage may vary</p>
